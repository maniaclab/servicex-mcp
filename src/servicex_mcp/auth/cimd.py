"""CIMD — Client ID Metadata Document support.

Implements ``draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document``: the OAuth
``client_id`` is itself an HTTPS URL that dereferences to the client's OAuth
metadata.  Unlike DCR (RFC 7591), there is no ``POST /register`` round-trip and
no server-side per-client database — the authorization server fetches the
``client_id`` URL at ``/authorize``, verifies the document is self-referential,
and validates the requested ``redirect_uri`` against the document's list.

This removes the DCR restart-fragility entirely (no in-memory registry to lose)
and avoids unbounded registration growth on hosted deployments.  Same rationale
as rucio-mcp: https://github.com/kratsg/rucio-mcp/issues/33.

Claude selects CIMD only when the AS metadata advertises both
``client_id_metadata_document_supported: true`` and ``"none"`` in
``token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported`` (the CIMD client authenticates as a
public client — PKCE only, no secret).  Both are set in ``server.py``.
